# Building Computers From Scratch

## Objective

The bread and butter of my love for tech, the building. I did this to save money on the computers in total and to gain an understading of what was exactly going in and going on inside the build. In total I have built 3 computers, 1 in progress for my father, and assisted with 1 for a friend. 2 of the built computers being my own.

### Skills Learned

- A great understaning of each piece of hardware.
- Underestanding how each piece of hardware correlated with eachother.
- Ability to troubleshoot and work through hardware compatibility.
- Different speeds of hardware.
- Allowed me to better troubleshoot problems that came down the road if a part stopped working or needed a specific firmware update
- Ability to navigate through a motherboards BIOS and make sure my ram speeds were up to par and nothing was bottlenecked.
- Installing a bootable image of Windows 10/11 PRO on a USB and boot from there.

### Tools Used

- Many youtube videos to solidify the knowledge.
- PCPartPicker.com to make sure compatibility was up to par and power wattage matched standards to the builds.
- Common hand tools youd find in a tool box at home.

## Steps


*Reference 1. All builds start in PCPARTPICKER.com after researching on new parts and seeing any price falls on past parts.*

*Reference 2. After selecting parts I make sure the compatbility of parts are in the green and then parts are ordered.*

*Reference 2. CON. If not Ill check the error message. If it is a size issue ill choose a different part. For example in one of my family member's build (and my current pc build) they wanted multiple Lian Li products which used multiple USB 2.0 Headers on the motherboard. The error being not enough USB headers. I bought an NZXT USB 2.0 Splitter to combat this issue. (Lian Li now fixed this common problem with making their own linking device, but at the time this was was not an option... PROBLEM SOLVING!!)*

*Reference 3. All parts are bought and now its time to assemble the beast. (Step Moms Computer)*

*Reference 4. A couple pictures of me assembling my step mom's PC... unfortunately these are the only photos I have of me assembling a computer. But a couple finished PCs will be shown below in "reference 5."*

*Reference 5. Finished products!!! As said in the "Objective" I have built 3, assisted with 1. I am showcasing in these photos 1 of my builds (Black), and my step mom's build (White)*
